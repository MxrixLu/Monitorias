/**
 * Admin Growth Repository
 *
 * Read-only aggregate queries powering the "Crecimiento" admin page:
 *   - Repeat / retention (do students come back?)
 *   - Retention cohorts (does retention improve month over month?)
 *   - Course profitability (which subjects make or lose money?)
 *
 * Same conventions as admin-metrics.repository: raw SQL via `$queryRaw`
 * (for DATE_TRUNC / window functions / PERCENTILE_CONT that Prisma's
 * groupBy can't express), Decimals coerced to JS numbers here, camelCase
 * keys returned so the service/API never deal with snake_case.
 *
 * Segmentation:
 *   - `careerId`  filters by the STUDENT's career (who our loyal customers
 *     are) — used by retention + cohorts.
 * Nullable params use `null` for "all". The `${x}::text IS NULL` guard makes
 * a single query serve both the filtered and unfiltered case.
