# Calico — Technical Specification

Full reference for the database schema, API routes, environment variables, and external services. For conventions and patterns see [../PATTERNS.md](../PATTERNS.md).

## Database Schema (PostgreSQL + Prisma)

Schema source: `prisma/schema.prisma`. Generated client: `src/generated/prisma/`.

### Tables

| Table | PK type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | UUID | Core user — auth, profile, role |
| `tutor_profiles` | UUID (userId) | Tutor-specific data (1:1 with user) |
| `tutor_applications` | UUID | Application to become a tutor |
| `tutor_courses` | composite (tutorId, courseId) | Many-to-many tutor ↔ course with per-course status and custom price |
| `departments` | UUID | Academic departments |
| `careers` | UUID | Academic careers (FK to department) |
| `courses` | UUID | Academic courses with complexity + base price; `career_id` FK to `careers` (`NOT NULL`, indexed) |
| `topics` | UUID | Course subtopics |
| `course_prices` | UUID | Admin-set override prices per course |
| `schedules` | UUID | Tutor schedule preferences (1:1 with user) |
| `availabilities` | UUID | Weekly recurring time blocks per tutor |
| `sessions` | UUID | Tutoring session (Individual or Group) |
| `session_participants` | composite (sessionId, studentId) | Students enrolled in a session |
| `session_attachments` | UUID | Files attached to a session |
| `payments` | UUID | Payment record per session |
| `reviews` | UUID | Bidirectional rating per session |
| `notifications` | UUID | In-app notifications |
| `admin_audit_log` | UUID | Immutable log of all admin mutations |

### Enums

```
Role:                       STUDENT | ADMIN
AuthProviderEnum:           Local | Google
ComplexityEnum:             Introductory | Foundational | Challenging
SessionTypeEnum:            Individual | Group
SessionStatusEnum:          Pending | Accepted | Rejected | Completed | Canceled
LocationTypeEnum:           Virtual | Custom
TutorApplicationStatusEnum: Pending | Approved | Rejected
TutorCourseStatusEnum:      Pending | Approved | Rejected
PaymentStatusEnum:          pending | paid | failed
TutorPayoutStatusEnum:      pending | paid
ReviewStatusEnum:           pending | done
```

> Majors/careers are **not** an enum. They are the `Department` + `Career` tables (UUID PKs). `User.careerId` is a UUID FK. The legacy `MajorEnum` was removed in the Firebase → PostgreSQL migration. `Course.careerId` is also a UUID FK to `Career` (every course belongs to exactly one career, matched from its `code` prefix — see migration `20260621000000_add_course_career_relation`).

### Key Fields

| Field | Table | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `role` | `users` | `STUDENT` or `ADMIN`. Read fresh from DB by `requireAdminUser` on every request — never trusted from JWT |
| `isTutorRequested` | `users` | User submitted a tutor application |
| `isTutorApproved` | `users` | User has at least one approved tutor subject |
| `isEmailVerified` | `users` | Hard login gate — JWT not issued until `true` |
| `isActive` | `users` | `false` = suspended. Checked by `requireAdminUser` |
| `lastSeenAt` | `users` | Last time user was in the app. Updated on login + `/api/auth/me` heartbeat (throttled 30 min). Powers admin "active users" metric |
| `suspendedAt` / `suspendedReason` | `users` | Set when admin suspends a tutor |
| `autoAcceptSession` | `schedules` | If `true`, incoming session requests are auto-accepted |
| `bufferTime` | `schedules` | Minutes between sessions (default 15) |
| `dayOfWeek` | `availabilities` | 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday) |
| `maxCapacity` | `sessions` | 1 for Individual, 2–20 for Group |
| `cancellationReason` | `sessions` | e.g. `TUTOR_SUSPENDED` for bulk cancellations |
| `status` | `tutor_courses` | `Pending / Approved / Rejected` per subject |

### Sensitive Fields (never expose in API responses)

`passwordHash`, `verificationToken`, `resetToken`, `otpCode`, `studentRating`

All repositories sanitize these. The `select` in admin user queries uses an explicit allow-list.

## External Services

### Brevo (Email)

REST API v3 (`https://api.sendinblue.com/v3/smtp/email`). Service: `src/lib/services/email.service.js`.

Single source of truth for template IDs is the `TEMPLATE_IDS` constant in that file:

| ID | Template | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Email verification | Registration |
| 3 | Password changed confirmation | Change password |
| 4 | Password reset link | Forgot password |
| 5 | Tutor application — admin notification | Application submitted |
| 7 | Session confirmed | Tutor accepts session |
| 8 | New session request / session cancelled (recipient) | Booking created / session canceled |
| 9 | Session cancelled — admin notification | Session canceled |
| 10 | Course request — admin notification | Tutor requests new subject |
| 11 | Tutor application approved | Admin approves tutor ⚠️ template not yet created in Brevo dashboard |
| 12 | Tutor application rejected | Admin rejects tutor ⚠️ template not yet created in Brevo dashboard |
| 13 | Tutor suspended | Admin suspends tutor ⚠️ template not yet created in Brevo dashboard |

Templates 11/12/13 are referenced in code but missing from the Brevo dashboard — see [../BACKLOG.md](../BACKLOG.md).

### AWS S3 (File Storage)

Service: `src/lib/s3.js`. Presigned URLs for direct browser → S3 uploads.

**Profile pictures flow:**
1. Client compresses to WebP 512×512 in Canvas
2. `POST /api/users/me/profile-picture/presigned-url` → presigned PUT URL (tagged `status=unconfirmed`)
3. Browser PUTs to S3
4. `PATCH /api/users/me/profile-picture` → verifies with `headObject`, persists public URL in `users.profile_picture_url`, flips tag to `confirmed`, deletes previous picture (only if under `profile-pictures/{userId}/` prefix — never touches external OAuth avatars)

**Bucket policy required** for profile pictures (stored as public URLs used as `<img src>`):
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::calico-uploads/profile-pictures/*"
}
```

**Recommended:** S3 Lifecycle rule that deletes objects tagged `status=unconfirmed` after 24h (orphan cleanup for abandoned uploads).

**Session attachments flow:**
- S3 key layout: `session-attachments/{subject-slug}/{YYYY-MM}/{batchId}/{filename}`
- Two upload entry points share the same layout: booking flow uses subject-scoped URLs; history flow uses session-scoped URLs
- Both register files via `/api/sessions/[id]/attachments/register`
- Client upload goes through `useFileUpload` hook — `uploadFiles()` returns fresh metadata; **do not read `uploadedFiles` right after awaiting an upload** (stale-closure trap)

### Wompi (Payments)

Colombian payments processor. Service: `src/lib/services/wompi.service.js`.

**Flow:**
1. Student calls `/api/payments/create-intent` → server computes price → returns Wompi reference
2. Frontend renders Wompi widget with the returned reference and server-signed `amountInCents`
3. Student completes payment in widget
4. Wompi calls `/api/payments/webhook` → HMAC verified against `WOMPI_INTEGRITY_SECRET` → updates payment + session status + triggers notifications

**Pricing:**
- `src/lib/payments/session-amount.js` — `pricePerHour(course)`, `sessionDurationHours(start, end)`, `computeSessionAmount(...)` — pure functions, safe to import client-side
- `src/lib/payments/pricing.js` — `resolveSessionAmount({ courseId, start, end })` — server-side only (loads from DB)
- `src/lib/payments/fees.js` — commission split + break-even math. **Single source of truth.**

### Google Calendar

Env vars: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`, `GOOGLE_ADMIN_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `CALICO_CALENDAR_ID`, `GDRIVE_PAYMENT_FOLDER_ID`

**Initial setup after deployment:**
1. Visit `https://your-domain.com/api/calendar/auth`
2. Login with `calico.tutorias@gmail.com`
3. Grant permissions

**Behavior:**
- On session **accept**: creates Google Calendar event with Meet link, invites both parties
- On session **cancel**: deletes the calendar event
- On availability sync: reads events from the tutor's `disponibilidad` calendar (read-only, 60-day window)
